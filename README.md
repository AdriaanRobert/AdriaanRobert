- 👋 Hi, I’m @AdriaanRobert @26 from Sweden 🇸🇪 
- 👀 The goal in sight is to land my first web dev job as a "self taught".
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a "full-stack" consisting of HTML, CSS, JS, Python SQL and PHP 😵‍💫
- 💞️ I’m also looking forward to learning from the "big dogs" on GitHub since I have a lot to learn 😰
- 🥳 Thanks for having me ❤️
